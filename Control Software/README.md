# Plasma Cutter Torch Height Controller (THC) - Code Overview

This repository contains the Arduino sketch for a Torch Height Controller (THC) designed for plasma cutting applications. The software controls a stepper motor to adjust the height of the plasma torch in real-time, ensuring optimal cutting quality by maintaining a consistent distance from the workpiece.

## Main Features

-   **Dynamic Height Adjustment**: Utilizes a PID control loop to adjust the torch height based on voltage feedback from the plasma arc.
-   **Stepper Motor Control**: Employs the `AccelStepper` library for precise control over the stepper motor, facilitating smooth and accurate height adjustments.
-   **Surface Probing**: Integrates a compressible Z-axis design for initial surface detection, ensuring accurate starting conditions for the cutting process.
-   **I2C Communication**: Reads voltage measurements from an ADS1115 ADC module for high-precision feedback.
-   **Watchdog Timer**: Implements a watchdog timer for system reliability, ensuring the controller recovers from any software malfunctions.

## File Structure

-   `THC_Stepper_V0_3_1a.ino`: The main Arduino sketch file that contains the setup and loop functions, along with the implementation of the PID control loop, stepper motor control, and initial surface probing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Arduino IDE (or compatible IDE) for compiling and uploading the sketch to an Arduino Nano.
-   An Arduino Nano, or a compatible microcontroller, flashed with this sketch.
-   A4988/DRV8825/TMC2130 or any other driver stepper motor driver module.
-   NEMA 17 stepper motor.
-   ADS1115 ADC module for arc voltage feedback.
-   Limit switch for the Z-axis homing function and another one for probing.

### Hardware Setup

1.  **Stepper Motor Connection**: Connect the NEMA 17 stepper motor to the DRV8825 driver. Ensure the driver is properly configured for the motor's current requirements.
2.  **ADS1115 Module**: Wire the ADS1115 module to the Arduino Nano via I2C (SDA to A4, SCL to A5 on Nano).
3.  **Limit Switch**: Connect the limit switch to the designated pin on the Arduino Nano for the homing function.
4.  **Power Supply**: Ensure the power supply meets the requirements for the stepper motor and the plasma cutter's control circuit.

### Software Configuration

1.  **Library Installation**: Install the `AccelStepper` library through the Arduino IDE Library Manager.
2.  **Adjust Parameters**: Review the sketch's configurable parameters, such as PID constants, stepper motor speeds, and acceleration settings, to match your specific hardware setup.
3.  **Compile and Upload**: Compile the sketch and upload it to your Arduino Nano.

## Usage

Upon powering up, the system will execute a homing routine to establish a known reference position. During plasma cutting operations, the system dynamically adjusts the torch height based on real-time feedback from the arc voltage sensor, ensuring consistent cut quality.
