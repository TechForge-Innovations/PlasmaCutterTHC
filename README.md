# PlasmaCutterTHC
This project develops a standalone THC for plasma cutting machines, designed to ensure optimal cutting quality by dynamically adjusting the torch height based on the arc voltage. Using Arduino Nano as the core controller, the system integrates with a DRV8825 stepper motor driver to control the Z-axis movement, providing precise height adjustments.
