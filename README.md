# Plasma Cutter Torch Height Controller (THC)
This project develops a standalone Torch Height Controller (THC) for plasma cutting applications, designed to ensure optimal cutting quality by dynamically adjusting the torch height based on the voltage feedback from the cutting arc. Utilizing an Arduino Nano as the core controller, the system integrates with a DRV8825 stepper motor driver to control the Z-axis movement, providing precise height adjustments.

## Key Features
- Dynamic Height Adjustment: Implements a PID control loop to adjust the torch height in real-time, enhancing cut quality.
- ADS1115 Integration: Utilizes the ADS1115 ADC for high-precision voltage measurement from the plasma arc, serving as the feedback for the PID controller.
- Stepper Motor Control: Employs the AccelStepper library for smooth and accurate control of the stepper motor, ensuring precise and responsive height adjustments.
- Non-Blocking Design: Uses timer interrupts for stepper motor control, allowing the main program loop to focus on PID calculations and sensor readings without delays.
- Robust Homing Routine: Features a homing routine using a limit switch, ensuring the system starts from a known position for reliable operation.
- Configurable Settings: Offers adjustable parameters for PID tuning, stepper motor speeds, and acceleration, allowing customization for different plasma cutters and materials.
- Safety Features: Implements error handling for I2C communication and uses a watchdog timer to enhance the system's reliability and safety.

## System Components
- Arduino Nano
- (A4988/DRV8825/TMC2130 standalone mode) Stepper Motor Driver
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
- ADS1115 ADC Module
- Limit Switch for Homing
- Potentiometer for Manual Setpoint Adjustment

## Application
The THC system is designed for hobbyist and professional plasma cutting tables where maintaining an optimal distance between the torch and workpiece is crucial for cut quality. The system is especially beneficial for cutting uneven materials or where the workpiece surface height varies.

## Getting Started
This section should include detailed setup instructions, wiring diagrams, and steps to compile and upload the code to the Arduino Nano. Additionally, explain how to calibrate the system for a specific plasma cutter and material thickness.
