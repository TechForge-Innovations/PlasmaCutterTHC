## Mechanical Design: Z-Axis Plasma THC Add-On

This repository now includes the design for a highly adaptable Z-axis add-on, engineered specifically for enhanced functionality with plasma cutting applications. This innovative component introduces a novel, free-moving design that seamlessly integrates with the Torch Height Controller (THC) system, optimizing both the initial surface probing process and subsequent dynamic height adjustments during cutting operations.

### Key Features:

-   **Free-Moving Design**: The Z-axis add-on is meticulously designed to allow unimpeded vertical movement. This feature is crucial for the initial probing phase, ensuring accurate surface detection by allowing the probe to make direct contact with the workpiece, thereby signaling the CNC controller upon successful surface location.
    
-   **Compressibility**: Uniquely engineered to be compressible, this add-on facilitates the essential probing step without the need for manual adjustments or rigid, fixed settings. This compressibility not only simplifies the probing process but also enhances its reliability and accuracy.
    
-   **Integrated THC Control**: Once the initial surface is detected and the probe's task is complete, the Z-axis add-on seamlessly transitions to THC mode. In this mode, it utilizes the Torch Height Controller to precisely manage the torch's vertical movements, adjusting the cutting height in real-time based on the feedback from the cutting arc. This dynamic adjustability ensures optimal cut quality and process efficiency.
    

### Application:

Designed with versatility in mind, this Z-axis add-on is an essential component for any plasma cutting setup seeking to automate and refine the cutting process. It elegantly bridges the gap between accurate surface probing and effective height control, making it a pivotal enhancement for achieving superior cutting outcomes.

### Integration:

Integrating this Z-axis add-on into your plasma cutting system is straightforward, thanks to its design consideration for ease of installation and compatibility. Detailed assembly instructions and integration guidelines are provided, ensuring a smooth setup process and immediate improvements in operational efficiency and cutting precision.
